# TDK-Website
This is the website to my upcoming video game

02.06.2024
I started working on the website and it looks pretty good, we didnt start working on the game yet but im starting to learn how to work in C# and Unity. After working in html, css and js for like a month, i can finally do some pretty good stuff without looking at tutorials, thats really dissapointing. See you next time.
